Stem Player Player

currently very basic.

1, 2, 3, 4 to toggle channels. Can be remapped.

1 - instrumental\
2 - vocals\
3 - bass\
4 - drums\
(i believe that's the numbers they download from the site)

DONE:
- custom paths
- custom keybinds (done via .JSON config file, completely replacable)

TODO:
- full control over channel volume
- after song ends to be able to play another
- ui?
